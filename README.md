# Definite-Time-Lag-Overcurrent-Relay-with-Load-Shedding-using-Arduino

We designed and implemented a Definite Time Lag (DTL) overcurrent relay system with load shedding capabilities. This project demonstrates practical application of power systems protection principles.

Features:
1) Arduino Mega-based microcontroller implementation
2) Current sensing and real-time monitoring
3) Automatic load shedding for non-critical circuits
 4) LCD display for system status and current readings

Technical Highlights:

1) Utilized DTL algorithm for overcurrent protection
2) Implemented moving filter for smooth current readings
3) Designed both software simulation (Proteus) and hardware prototype
4) Tested with multiple incandescent bulbs as loads

Outcomes:

1) Successfully demonstrated overcurrent protection and load shedding
2) Validated system's ability to maintain power to critical (VIP) loads
3) Explored potential improvements including IDMTL algorithm adoption and enhanced user interface

This project showcases skills in embedded systems programming, electrical protection systems, and practical implementation of power management solutions.
